## Ubiquitous language

Coding is naming. 
Naming is key.

A ubiquitous language is a vocabulary shared by everyone involved in a project, from domain experts to stakeholders, to project managers, to developers. 
This language should be used in all documentation, tickets, conversations, meeting invites, post-it notes on your computer, chalkboards that only appear in your dreams — everywhere. 
The goal is to reduce the ambiguity of communication.
